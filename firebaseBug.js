The following code snippet demonstrates an uncommon Firebase error related to security rules and data structure.  It attempts to access a nested field in the database but fails due to an improperly configured security rule that doesn't grant read access to that specific nested field. 

```javascript
firebase.database().ref('users/' + userId + '/profile/address/city').once('value', (snapshot) => {
  const city = snapshot.val();
  console.log(city); // This might fail due to insufficient security rule permissions
});
```
